# natours
A landing page for a fictional Natours tour company. This is a study project done on Jonas Schmedtmann's course "Advanced CSS and Sass".

The website is almost pure CSS and HTML, with an exception of two popup modules. Includes some nice CSS features like background video, custom animations nad clips.
Mostly done according to instructor's design, though I did implement popups differently using Javascript, 
used a simple flexbox grid instead of floats and added extra crossbrowser and mobile optimisation.

Optimized for mobile and desktop devices, browser support and fallbacks provided up to IE11. Lighthouse performance metrics
